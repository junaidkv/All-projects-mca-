    There are four types of real estate:
    Residential includes both new construction and resale homes. The most common category is single-family homes. There are also condominiums, coops, townhouses, duplexes, triple-deckers, quadplexes, high-value homes and vacation homes.
    Commercial Real Estate includes shopping centers and strip malls, hotels and offices including medical and educational buildings. Apartment buildings are often considered commercial, even though they are used for residences. That's because they are owned to produce income.
    Industrial includes manufacturing buildings and property, as well as warehouses. The buildings can be used for research, production, storage and distribution of goods. That's sometimes considered commercial real estate, even though the zoning, construction and sales are handled differently.
    Land includes vacant land, working farms, and ranches. The subcategories within vacant land include undeveloped, early development or reuse, subdivision and site assembly. Here's more at Land Broker Transactions.

Real estate also refers to producing, buying and selling real estate. The real estate industry is a critical driver of economic growth.

Construction of new buildings is a component of gross domestic product. It includes both residential, commercial and industrial buildings.

New home building is a critical category. It includes construction of single-family homes, townhouses and villas. The National Association of Home Builders provides monthly data on homes sold and average prices. It publishes data on new home sales. That tells you how the housing market will do in nine months. The NAHB reports new home starts, which is when ground is broken. For more, see NAHB Construction Statistics.

Real estate agents assist homeowners, businesses, and investors buy and sell all four types of properties. The industry is typically divided up into specialists that focus on one of the types.

Sellers' agents help find buyers through either the Multiple Listing Service or their professional contacts. They price your property, using comparative listings of recently sold properties known as "comps." The can help you spruce up your property so it will look its best to customers.

They know the local market. That means they can find a property that meets your most important criteria. They also compare prices, called "doing comps." It allows them to guide you to areas that are affordable. Buyers' agents negotiate for you, pointing out reasons why the seller should accept a lower price.

Real estate agents who want to increase their professionalism become REALTORS®. The National Association of REALTORS®  publishes provides monthly reports on the number of homes resold and their average price.

It's a better indicator of the health of the housing industry than new home construction. That's because new home builders can be overenthusiastic about future sales, and overbuild. They can also cut prices to force sales. Individual homeowners must follow the market's supply and demand. They don't have the clout to manipulate the market.
